There are n houses on a street, numbered 1,2,…,n. The distance of houses a and b is |a-b|. You know the number of children in each house.

Your task is to establish k schools in such a way that each school is in some house. Then, each child goes to the nearest school. What is the minimum total walking distance of the children if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of houses and the number of schools. The houses are numbered 1,2…,n.

After this, there are n integers c\_1,c\_2,…,c\_n: the number of children in each house.

# Output

Print the minimum total distance.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3000
- 1 ≤ c\_i ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>

# Example

Input:

```
6 2
2 7 1 4 6 4
```

Output:

```
11
