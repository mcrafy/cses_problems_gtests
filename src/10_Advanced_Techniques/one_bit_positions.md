# One Bit Positions

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a binary string of length n. Your task is to calculate, for every k between 1 \ldots n-1, the number of ways we can choose two positions i and j such that i-j=k and there is a one-bit at both positions.

# Input

The only input line has a string that consists only of characters 0 and 1.

# Output

For every distance k between 1\ldots n-1 print the number of ways we can choose two such positions.

# Constraints

- 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>

# Example

Input:

```
1001011010
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 0 2 1 0 1 0
```
