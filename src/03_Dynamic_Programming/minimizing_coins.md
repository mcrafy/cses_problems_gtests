# Minimizing Coins

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money x using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are \{1,5,7\} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins.

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has n distinct integers c\_1,c\_2,…,c\_n: the value of each coin.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print -1.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ x ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>
- 1 ≤ c\_i ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>

# Example

Input:

```
3 11
1 5 7
```

Output:

```
3
```
