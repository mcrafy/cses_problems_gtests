# Coin Collector

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A game has n rooms and m tunnels between them. Each room has a certain number of coins. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect while moving through the tunnels when you can freely choose your starting and ending room?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then, there are n integers k\_1,k\_2,\ldots,k\_n: the number of coins in each room.

Finally, there are m lines describing the tunnels. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a tunnel from room a to room b. Each tunnel is a one-way tunnel.

# Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of coins you can collect.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ k\_i ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

# Example

Input:

```
4 4
4 5 2 7
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 4
```

Output:

```
16
```
