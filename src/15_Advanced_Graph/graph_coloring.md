# Graph Coloring

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a simple graph with n nodes and m edges. Your task is to use the minimum possible number of colors to color each node such that no edge connects two nodes of the same color.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1, 2,…, n.

Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge connecting nodes a and b.

# Output

First, print an integer k: the minimum number of colors.

After this, print n integers c\_1, c\_2,…, c\_n: the colors of the nodes. The colors should satisfy 1 ≤ c\_i ≤ k.

You may print any valid solution.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 16
- 0 ≤ m ≤ \frac{n(n-1)}{2}

# Example

Input:

```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```

Output:

```
2
1 2 1 2
```
