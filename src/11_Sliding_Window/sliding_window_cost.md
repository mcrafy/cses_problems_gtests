# Sliding Window Cost

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of k elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.

You can increase or decrease each element with cost x where x is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.

# Input

The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.

Then there are n integers x\_1,x\_2,\ldots,x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Output n-k+1 values: the costs.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ x\_i ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>

# Example

Input:

```
8 3
2 4 3 5 8 1 2 1
```

Output:

```
2 2 5 7 7 1
```
