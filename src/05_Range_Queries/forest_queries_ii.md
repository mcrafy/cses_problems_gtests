# Forest Queries Ii

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an n × n grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or has a tree. Your task is to process q queries of the following types:

1. Change the state (empty/tree) of a square.
2. How many trees are inside a rectangle in the forest?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are n lines describing the forest. Each line has n characters: `.` is an empty square and `*` is a tree.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "1 y x" or "2 y\_1 x\_1 y\_2 x\_2".

# Output

Print the answer to each query of the second type.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ y,x ≤ n
- 1 ≤ y\_1 ≤ y\_2 ≤ n
- 1 ≤ x\_1 ≤ x\_2 ≤ n

# Example

Input:

```
4 3
.*..
*.**
**..
****
2 2 2 3 4
1 3 3
2 2 2 3 4
```

Output:

```
3
4
```
