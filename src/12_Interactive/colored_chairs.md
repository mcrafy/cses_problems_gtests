# Colored Chairs

- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are n chairs arranged in a circle. Each chair is either red or blue. The chairs are numbered 1, 2,…, n; chairs i and i+1 are next to each other for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Here chair n+1 refers to chair 1.

Your task is to find two chairs that have the same color and are next to each other.

To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a chair and you will be told the color of that chair.

# Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should start by reading a single integer n: the number of chairs.

On your turn, you can print one of the following:

- "?\ i", where 1 ≤ i ≤ n: ask the color of chair i. The grader will return `R` or `B` for red or blue.
- "!\ i": report that chairs i and i+1 have the same color. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

# Constraints

- 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>, n is odd
- you can ask at most 20 questions of type ?

# Example

```
5
? 1
R
? 2
B
? 3
B
! 2
```
