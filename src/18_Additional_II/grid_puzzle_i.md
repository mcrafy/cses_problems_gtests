- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is an n × n grid, and your task is to choose from each row and column some number of squares. How can you do that?

# Input

The first input line has an integer n: the size of the grid. The rows and columns are numbered 1,2,…,n.

The next line has n integers a\_1,a\_2,\ldots,a\_n: You must choose exactly a\_i squares from the ith row.

The las line has n integers b\_1,b\_2,\ldots,b\_n: You must choose exactly b\_j squares from the jth column.

# Output

Print n lines describing which squares you choose (`X` means that you choose a square, `.` means that you don't choose it). You can print any valid solution.

If it is not possible to satisfy the conditions print only -1.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- 0 ≤ a\_i ≤ n
- 0 ≤ b\_j ≤ n

# Example

Input:

```
5
0 1 3 2 0
1 2 2 0 1
```

Output:

```
.....
..X..
.XX.X
XX...
.....
```
