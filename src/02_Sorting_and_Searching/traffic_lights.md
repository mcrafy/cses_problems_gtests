- **Time limit:** 1.00 s
- **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is a street of length x whose positions are numbered 0,1,\ldots,x. Initially there are no traffic lights, but n sets of traffic lights are added to the street one after another.

Your task is to calculate the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

# Input

The first input line contains two integers x and n: the length of the street and the number of sets of traffic lights.

Then, the next line contains n integers p\_1,p\_2,\ldots,p\_n: the position of each set of traffic lights. Each position is distinct.

# Output

Print the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ x ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 < p\_i < x

# Example

Input:

```
8 3
3 6 2
```

Output:

```
5 3 3
```
